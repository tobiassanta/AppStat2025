    "# Random Digits Exercice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This is an exercise in hypothesis testing, specifically determining if a series of digits [0,9] is random or not, and if the origin is human (i.e. yourself!). In order to determine this, one has to design and apply statistical tests, from which the degree of consistency of being random can be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your task:\n",
    "Using tests of your choice/design, determine which of the seven data sets are consistent with being random, and which aren't. One is based on the digits you entered in the course questionaire, while the others range from obviously non-random over poor/quasi random to truly random. See if you among these can determine your (human) dataset.\n",
