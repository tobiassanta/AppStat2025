    " 1. Does the \"bad\" fit work well? Does it extract the parameters used to produce it?\n",

    "_5-10 minutes later_...\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "For once it is not the initial values! The reason is that the \"bad\" fitting function has two flaws:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It does not have a correct normalisation, thus making N1 and N2 correlated, as well as tau1 and tau2.\n",
    "* It does not have a single overall normalisation, thus making N1 and N2 even more correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives very high correlations between the parameters, as can be seen from the correlation matrix printed.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Both of these problems can be mitigated by rewriting the fitting function to include\n",
    "    the correct normalisation (i.e. dividing by the lifetime) and by putting only one\n",
    "    overall normalisation and then dividing the two lifetimes with a fraction (i.e. use\n",
    "    \"frac\" and \"(1.0-frac)\" as a parameter in front of each exponential term).\n",
    "    Try this (define a \"good\" function), and see if your fit improves. The way to see\n",
    "    this would in general be to try a lot of different data, but here we will simply see\n",
    "    that the correlations are smaller (especially for the overall normalisation).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you didn't manage to get this fit going, I've included a \"good\" fitting function below! (but try yourself first!)\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. The two lifetimes are naturally very correlated with each other (and the fraction),\n",
    "    when they are very alike. The only thing one can do about this is to fix one parameter.\n",
    "    Fixing a parameter is of course not desirable, but one can be forced to do it, if the fit does\n",
    "    not converge otherwise. Note that since the correlation is very high, it is not a great\n",

    "    Fix one parameter and see to what extend the fit becomes less correlated, the other parameters\n",
    "    more precisely determined, and the quality of the fit improves.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Finally, is it appropriate to fit the data with a ChiSquare? If not, then you should know what\n",
    "    to do instead. A simpler alternative might be to simply change the binning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: A very similar and common example is fitting a \"Gaussian-like\" peak, which happens to have\n",
    "more than one width, for example if the data is obtained from two or more sources with\n",
    "different resolutions. Here, one may choose to let the two (or more) Gaussians have\n",
