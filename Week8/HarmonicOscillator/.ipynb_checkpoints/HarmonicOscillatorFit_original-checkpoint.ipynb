    "# Real Harmonic Oscillator Data\n",

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is about more advanced fitting of data, specifically **starting with a simple fit and building a more advanced one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to begin with the simplest possible function that even remotely does the job, which is then expanded to accommodate all the features present in the data fitted. The data is from three versions of a damped harmonic oscillator, consisting of a weight hanging from a spring, but with different damping:\n",
    "- No additional damping.\n",
    "- More damping from a round piece of cardboard, which increases the drag (most interesting dataset!).\n",
    "- Damping from friction of the weight against metal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional form of a damped harmonic oscillator:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function to fit the overall 1st and 2nd case with is known in physics as the damped harmonic oscillator, where position $p$ as a function of time $t$ behaves as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(t) = A \\gamma \\cdot\\sin(\\omega t+\\phi) \\cdot\\exp(-\\gamma t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3rd case is a little different, as should become clear once plotted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your task\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the various dataset, and try to fit them with an appropriate function. The first challenge is to get the fit working at all. Once this is in place, considering the patterns in the fit residuals should give you an idea of what to further include in the fit. Play around with various possible additions to the function, discussing with your peers. Remember to try to fit all three datasets.\n",
